Hi Mum,


This program interprets lists of names into a sociogram.
Each line contain a person followed by their list of friends.
The first line of input is the title and ignored for now.
You can drag a csv or text file into the box,
or copy paste text into it.

There are different ways to layout the graph,
my favorite is BoundedFR.
Mouse over highlights who their friends are,
and drag names around.

In the top right is displayed a summary
of number of friends.
We can see Jesse and Ryan are very popular.

Also there is a list of people who did not nominate
three friends.  This is so you can fix data errors.
In this case Devi has been entered as both
Devi and Devshree, lets fix that.
Great! Zack has a typo... and so does Brownlow

Ok now we have all our data...

Josh is isolated.

Daniel and Josh are the only links between girls and boys.

If Toby wants Tayla to join his basketball team,
he should ask Josiah to ask Josh to ask Tayla.

If you want to print the chart out, you'll will have
to rely on screencapture for now...
For example if you click start and search for snip
you can save it as an image and then print it later.

To install this program, just unzip somewhere on your
computer. You can make a desktop shortcut to it
by right clicking on it.


Love you heaps,
Timothy and Shin Nee.
